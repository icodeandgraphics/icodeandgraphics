                <h4>What is website development, and why is it important for my business?</h4>
                <p>
                    Having a website is crucial for any business in today's digital age as it serves as a digital storefront for your business, allowing customers to learn about your products and services, make purchases, and contact you. A website can also help build credibility, increase brand awareness, and expand your reach to a wider audience. In short, website development is an essential investment for any business looking to establish a strong online presence and grow its customer base.                </p>

            <div class="question__answer">
                <h4>How long does it take to develop a website, and what is the cost?</h4>
                <p>
                    The time and cost of website development depend on various factors such as the size and complexity of the website, the features and functionalities required, and the expertise of the development team.

                    For a simple website with basic features, development can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. However, for a more complex website with custom functionalities, it may take several months to complete the development process.
                    
                    As for the cost, it can vary greatly depending on the scope of the project and the hourly rate of the development team. On average, a simple website can cost anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, while a more complex website can cost tens of thousands of dollars or more.
                    
                    It's important to discuss the specific requirements and goals of your website with a development team to get an accurate estimate of the time and cost involved in the development process.                </p>
